# FPGA Bitstream for DE10-Nano SoC and Cyclone V SoC FPGA.
Note that FPGA bitstreams are very specific to the board and FPGA version. If yours differs, a recompilation from the Verilog sources using Quartus II is required.

This bitstream may be loaded using the Altera loader JTAG loader utility without having to recompile the project.
